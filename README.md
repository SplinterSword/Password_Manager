# Password Manager

This is my own password manager created using Reactjs for the frontend and NodeJs for the backend. 
MongoDB is used for database storage.

## Frontend

Just go in the root directory and type in terminal
```
npm install
npm run dev
```

## Backend

Just go in the root directory and type in terminal
```
cd backend
node server.js
```

Make sure to change the .env to have your MongoDB_URI
